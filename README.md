# Voltage Reader GUI
ADC Voltage with Serial Communication Graphic User Interface
This graphic interface was designed and written for personal purposes. It was designed using Visual Studio 2017 and written in C#.  The main purpose was to send a fetch signal and receive data from a serial port, compare it to known values and display a different color of “led” to show if its in range. It contains a combobox to show the serial connections available (Fig.1), two buttons to choose which read out is being compared (Fig. 2). A start button to begin establish serial connection and begin processing the data received. (Fig. 3). Data comparison will begin immediately after the start button is pressed and if the value is within a certain range an “led’ will light up. (Fig. 4).
Serial connection is established with an external microcontroller that sends data every time a fetch command is received. The external microcontroller is taking analog voltage readouts from a switch that is manually actuated. Converting the analog voltage to a digital value and sending it out for display in the GUI.
